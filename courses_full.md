What's in this Section? Page Completion Select activity Viewing Task Viewing Task Interactive Task Completion There's a lot to think about when it comes to planning your university application. Don‚Äôt worry, though - we've broken it down for you into manageable steps. Maybe you already have an idea of some of the steps you will need to take. If so, this section will help you to build a solid plan and make sure you haven't forgotten anything crucial. Or maybe you don't have a plan at all! Either way, the video below will take you through: the most important things you need to consider when, ideally, you should take each step in the process. Viewing Task Watch the video and note down at least six key things you still need to do in the application process and when it would be best to do them. Let's look again at the entire application process. Paying attention to all these aspects will help you choose a university and a course that are right for you, and help you to be better prepared and organised during the application process. Select activity Practice Task Practice Task Quiz Completion Select activity Interactive Reading Task Interactive Reading Task Interactive Task Completion Interactive Reading Task You now know more about the different stages of the application process and should have an idea of some steps you can take right away, as well as more long-term goals. There are many benefits that come from planning your university application at the earliest opportunity. Some universities begin to make offers as soon as UCAS opens its Apply system in September, so if you wait until the deadline, there will be fewer places available. If you're applying to Oxbridge and/or for medicine, you have to submit your application in October instead of January. Interact with the infographic below to find out more about the reasons for starting your application early. Select activity Journal Task Journal Task URL Completion Select activity Practice Task Practice Task Quiz Completion Select activity Personalisation Task Personalisation Task Interactive Task Completion We all have different hopes, needs and expectations. Your personal values are important factors for deciding on a degree; if you factor them into your planning, you are much more likely to find one you are happy with. Let's explore how you can identify your personal values when choosing a course and a university. Personalisation Task Firstly, it will be easier to make sound choices if you take some time to identify your values. What is most important to you? Start the task below and respond to each question. Review the feedback and note down any advice that you hadn't considered in your Journal . Select activity Viewing Task Viewing Task Page Completion Select activity Practice Task Practice Task H5P Completion Select activity Interactive Viewing Task Interactive Viewing Task Interactive Task Completion Interactive Viewing Task Alex has always wanted to go to a top university that is internationally recognised. He is really into rowing - he competes in his regional rowing team - and would like to keep this up wherever he goes to uni. His preference is for socialising with a few friends over lots of nightlife choices. Read through the text and choose what you think are the best options at each stage of the story. Select activity Interactive Viewing Task Interactive Viewing Task Interactive Task Completion As well as academic considerations, it is important to understand the financial implications of studying at university. How much will it cost and when will you have to pay back any loans? In this section, we'll look at the fees and other costs associated with undergraduate study, as well as the sources of funding that may be available to you. Interactive Reading Task Start and work through the presentation below to learn about some of the main costs and sources of funding that you should be aware of. Select activity Funding for University Funding for University URL Completion Select activity Your University Application Your University Application Page Completion Select activity Reflect on your Learning Reflect on your Learning URL Completion Select activity End of Section End of Section Page Completion Select activity Section 1 Student Feedback Section 1 Student Feedback Questionnaire Select activity What's in this Section? What's in this Section? Page Completion Select activity Reading Task Reading Task Interactive Task Completion Deciding which subject you are going to study at university is the first step in the application process. You probably have some favourite subjects at school, which would be a good starting point. UCAS lists over 50,000 different undergraduate courses, so you'll need a strategy for narrowing down your options. One way to do this is to start by thinking about broad subject areas, based on your current studies and interests, then gradually focusing on a manageable number of courses. You'll also need to think about which type of course is right for you ‚Äì for example, Single, Joint or Combined Honours. Reading Task Read the presentation and make notes in your Journal about the main areas you'll need to consider when choosing a course. Work through all of the slides to complete the task. Select activity Interactive Viewing Task Interactive Viewing Task Interactive Task Completion Now look at your notes again and add any initial ideas to each area. These can be: things you are certain about already and know will be important for you things you think may be important for you, but still have some questions about things you are very unsure about and need to do more research on. Interactive Viewing Task Jasmine, Jonathan and Helen are three friends applying for university. They have decided to set up a chat group to discuss their research into university courses. Read their discussion carefully and answer the questions that follow. Select activity Practice Task Practice Task H5P Completion Select activity Interactive Reading Task Interactive Reading Task Interactive Task Completion You might be considering taking a course that you didn't study at school. These undiscovered subjects give you the opportunity to explore something completely new. There are often fewer applicants for these types of courses, meaning you stand a better chance of getting a place at a top university. In some cases, the subject-matter of these courses will probably be familiar even if you haven't studied them, for example, Archaeology. However, the reality of studying them could be different from any pre-conceived ideas you have about them. You should always look carefully at what a course actually involves, and this is especially true for subjects that you have no previous experience of studying. Interactive Reading Task Interact with the infographic below to find out more about any of the undiscovered subjects you find interesting. In your Journal, note down questions you would like to answer about the subjects by doing more research (or a different undiscovered subject, if none of them appealed to you). Select activity Practice Task Practice Task Page Completion Select activity Survey Task Survey Task Questionnaire Completion Select activity Additional Resources Additional Resources Page Completion Select activity Viewing Task Viewing Task Page Completion Select activity Practice Task Practice Task Interactive Task Completion Practice Task Now that you have thought about what is important for you in a course and seen the different types of courses available, you should be able to start narrowing down your options. To help you do this, we have provided a decision matrix that you can use to compare courses. What is a decision matrix? A decision matrix is a good way to make decisions when there are lots of different factors which may be difficult to compare. First, you choose the factors that are important to you, then you decide how important each factor is. After that, you rate each option (in this case, courses at different universities) against the different factors. Using the decision matrix, you can objectively compare courses to one another across the different factors you are prioritising. This isn't an exact science, but it offers another way of evaluating your course choices. Your reaction to which courses score high and low can also reveal the ones that you really prefer. Let's get started! Download a copy of the Excel decision matrix template . Review the infographic and the instructions provided in the Excel template. Complete your decision matrix to identify which of your choices meets your priorities.

As well as the opportunities to learn or improve a second language, immersing yourself in a new culture and its customs will expand your horizons and show future employers that you are resourceful and embrace challenges. Studying in an international setting, you will be surrounded by different views and perspectives, which can be a very enriching experience. It may also be cheaper to study abroad, depending on where you are from and the country you choose.

A decision matrix is a good way to make decisions when there are lots of different factors which may be difficult to compare. First, you choose the factors that are important to you, then you decide how important each factor is. After that, you rate each option (in this case, courses at different universities) against the different factors. Using the decision matrix, you can objectively compare courses to one another across the different factors you are prioritising.

We all have different hopes, needs and expectations. Your personal values are important factors for deciding on a degree; if you factor them into your planning, you are much more likely to find one you are happy with. Let's explore how you can identify your personal values when choosing a course and a university.
Firstly, it will be easier to make sound choices if you take some time to identify your values. What is most important to you?

Throughout the course, we will ask you to record your learning about your choices for university in your Application Planner. We have provided a template for this and when you have completed each section of the course, we will ask you to also complete the relevant part of the Planner. At the end of the course, you will have a record of your course and university choices and how you came to those decisions. This will help you write your personal statement and prepare for interviews.
Complete the first part of the Application Planner , adding in the dates for your timeline for applying for university and reflecting on your values for university.
When you‚Äôve finished, save the template on your computer, as you will come back to it to complete in the next section.

Deciding which subject you are going to study at university is the first step in the application process. You probably have some favourite subjects at school, which would be a good starting point. UCAS lists over 50,000 different undergraduate courses, so you'll need a strategy for narrowing down your options. One way to do this is to start by thinking about broad subject areas, based on your current studies and interests, then gradually focusing on a manageable number of courses. You'll also need to think about which type of course is right for you ‚Äì for example, Single, Joint or Combined Honours.

You might be considering taking a course that you didn't study at school. These undiscovered subjects give you the opportunity to explore something completely new. There are often fewer applicants for these types of courses, meaning you stand a better chance of getting a place at a top university.
In some cases, the subject-matter of these courses will probably be familiar even if you haven't studied them, for example, Archaeology. However, the reality of studying them could be different from any pre-conceived ideas you have about them. You should always look carefully at what a course actually involves, and this is especially true for subjects that you have no previous experience of studying.
Interact with the infographic below to find out more about any of the undiscovered subjects you find interesting. In your Journal, note down questions you would like to answer about the subjects by doing more research (or a different undiscovered subject, if none of them appealed to you).

Now that you have thought about what is important for you in a course and seen the different types of courses available, you should be able to start narrowing down your options. To help you do this, we have provided a decision matrix that you can use to compare courses.
What is a decision matrix? A decision matrix is a good way to make decisions when there are lots of different factors which may be difficult to compare. First, you choose the factors that are important to you, then you decide how important each factor is. After that, you rate each option (in this case, courses at different universities) against the different factors. Using the decision matrix, you can objectively compare courses to one another across the different factors you are prioritising. This isn't an exact science, but it offers another way of evaluating your course choices. Your reaction to which courses score high and low can also reveal the ones that you really prefer.
Let's get started!

Looking at your completed diagram, how do you feel? Have some courses scored higher than you expected? If these courses were not your favourites at the beginning, what was it about them that put you off? Has their high ranking made you consider them more carefully?
On the other hand, some of your frontrunners may have scored lower than you expected. Are the priorities that led to their lower score so important that you might rule out that course, or would you be willing to compromise because the course impresses you in other areas?
Your priorities may change as you research more courses and think more about what is important to you. Keep your diagram updated by adding new priorities as they occur to you. When you find a new course, add that to your diagram too.

Wherever in the world you live, studying abroad has a range of benefits that can make it worth considering. As well as the opportunities to learn or improve a second language, immersing yourself in a new culture and its customs will expand your horizons and show future employers that you are resourceful and embrace challenges. Studying in an international setting, you will be surrounded by different views and perspectives, which can be a very enriching experience. It may also be cheaper to study abroad, depending on where you are from and the country you choose.

##### Glossary
Campus University: A university in which all of the academic buildings and often the student accommodation are situated on one centralised campus.
City University: A university in which all of the academic buildings and student accommodation are spread out in different locations across a city.
Firm choice: Once a student has all of their offers, the course they select as a firm choice is the one they will attend providing they meet the grade requirements.
Insurance choice: Once a student has all of their offers, the course they select as an insurance choice is the one they will attend if they fail to meet the grade requirements at their firm choice. It is therefore a back-up option and should have lower grade requirements than the firm choice.
Oxbridge: An abbreviated way of referring to Oxford and Cambridge, the two oldest and most prestigious British universities.
Russell Group: 24 top UK universities, rated highly internationally for their research and teaching.
Specialised institution: A university which is renowned for its teaching and research in a particular subject or subject area, even if the university doesn't rank highly on league tables.
UCAS: Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. This is the organisation that operates the British university application process. Typically, students will apply to five universities through UCAS.
UCAS Adjustment: A UCAS service for students who have exceeded the grade requirements for their firm and insurance course. Through UCAS Track, students can search for better courses at other universities and contact the corresponding admissions office to find out if places are available.
UCAS Clearing: A UCAS service for students who have not met the grade requirements for their firm or insurance course. Courses with available places are advertised through clearing and students can phone through to operators who will help them find a course they meet the requirements for.
UCAS Extra: This service allows students to apply to an additional university course through UCAS, if they have not received offers, or have declined offers, from their five choices.
UCAS Track: The online portal students use to receive updates on their course applications. Any changes made through adjustment or clearing will also be visible here.

##### üòÉ Welcome
Hello, and welcome to the EtonX Creative Problem Solving course. My name's Vaughan Clark and I teach History and Art History. I'm very interested in creative thinking and I contribute to the development of creative-thinking skills at Eton. As Course Director of the Creative Problem Solving course, I'll be supporting you through regular video input throughout this programme.
Creative problem solving has been ranked among the top skills that people need to succeed in the 21st century. That's because people who can think creatively are better equipped to come up with original solutions to the constantly evolving problems of our modern world. They know how to analyse a problem and evaluate potential solutions. They know how to generate lots of original ideas and their thinking isn't limited by the accepted norms of what has gone before. It's no surprise, then, that an increasing number of universities and employers are looking to recruit employees with strong creative-thinking and problem-solving skills.
You'll be learning a lot of new concepts and techniques to enhance your creative problem-solving skills. Some people think that creativity is something that only the lucky few are born with, but that's not the case. As we will demonstrate, creative thinking is a skill that can be learnt and developed. You may find the course challenging at times but it's important that you persevere as that's a vital part of the creative process. You'll soon have the chance to put your newfound skills into practice, as there are opportunities for using creative problem solving all around us in everyday life. This course will help you to develop your creative problem-solving skills by exposing you to a range of techniques and ideas that are used in the business and product development worlds, as well as arts industries. You'll learn how to brainstorm new ideas and fuse existing ideas into new concepts. You'll learn how to give and get feedback on your ideas and evaluate the feedback you get from others. These latest techniques will really help you to approach creative thinking with confidence.
I hope you're looking forward to lots of inspiring material and activities to help you learn how to improve your creative problem-solving skills, whether you would like to come up with more ideas quickly or learn how to share your creative ideas with confidence. Finally, I hope you enjoy doing this course as much as we've enjoyed creating it for you. Good luck.

Having a creative role model can be really useful, as you can turn to and develop an understanding of their work and their working processes that can help feed into your own.

Bill: So my creativity role model would be my aunt, and it's because she's an artist and so I have always from a young age aspired to grow up and be like her. And I don't think it's necessarily a kind of genetic, like, genetic link that we have. I think it's just being exposed to her being creative as I grew up and always encouraging that side of me, throughout my childhood and still today. And so I'd say that's why she is my creative role model.
Venetia: I'd say my creative role model would probably be my mum, because she's shown me that creativity isn't just, sort of, doing still life drawing. It can be filtered into everyday life, and especially through, sort of, cooking, and even, like, in the house: just the way she thinks about what goes where; she's always constantly thinking what's the cleverest, most innovative way of doing things, without just going straight to a shop and doing what everyone else does.
Athena: My creativity role model isn't a real person, they're figurative. They're from my favourite TV show, which is about medicine, which is what I want to go into as my career, and they're surgeons, so they're often faced with very complex and strange illnesses. And a massive part of the TV show is them overcoming ways to fight that in surgery, so maybe using a ping pong ball in surgery or something wild that no one's ever done before, in order to overcome the problem, which I think is amazing, because they're always, kind of, exploring new ideas and the way that they approach these ideas I find really inspirational.

What do you do if you're struggling to come up with ideas for a project? In this section, Organisational Psychologist, Adam Grant, shares his research about the habits that can help you overcome this problem. The focus of this section is on opening your mind to inspiration, rapidly generating ideas and playing around with ideas to come up with even more ideas. Everyone's different, so experiment with these techniques to find what works best for you.

In his talk Adam Grant showed a graph like this to demonstrate that there is a sweet spot for procrastination which helps people come up with more creative ideas:
In the following tasks, you are going to apply this graph.
##### Viewing Task
We asked Venetia, Bill and Athena about how much they procrastinate and how they feel about it.

Athena: Procrastination isn't something I tend to indulge in a lot because I'm quite a busy person so for me I, kind of, need to get things done when they need to be done. So I find procrastination can be not a very useful tool, but often it's needed for creativity which hinders the process and can seem very frustrating. But talking to other people, taking some time out instead of starting that work straight away might give you a better viewpoint than when you would've originally read the question or the problem and tried to answer it.
Bill: My attitude to procrastination is that it's something that I struggle with quite a lot on a day-to-day basis, and so what I do when I get stuck on a project or I just can't face it anymore is I'll just go and do a menial task, like tidy my room or do my laundry, and it will really help to just, like, flush out all of the struggles that I was having with the project and reset my brain and so I can go back to it later on.
Venetia: I definitely do procrastinate and I really don't like it, but I think the best thing to do is recognise it, and once you've recognised it, you can start to act on it. And it can also be helpful, because if you go straight into a task then you're only going to have a few ideas, whereas if you let it, sort of, sink in for a bit and delay it then more inspiration might come, so it can come in handy.

So far you've learnt about creating the right conditions for creative thinking and some activities you can try out to develop your creativity. Now you're going to learn about a method that you can use to come up with many ideas to solve a problem or, in fact, for any creative task that you'd like to approach. This method can be used whether you're working on your own or in a group. It's called divergent thinking.

Divergent thinking is a very important part of the creative process and a key skill to develop in order to be able to generate innovative ideas. Divergent thinking is a spontaneous thinking process that enables people to come up with lots of ideas. It can also help you think differently and explore a wide range of possibilities.
The goals of divergent thinking should be: to focus on quantity of ideas, to avoid making judgements about whether these ideas are good or bad, to produce the most crazy and impossible ideas you can think of, and to combine ideas to make new and hybrid ideas. When you use divergent thinking, you should work quickly to brainstorm as many ideas as you possibly can. Judgement and evaluation are the enemies of divergent thinking. This process is usually best done with an extreme target number of, say, 30 to 50 ideas and a very tight time limit of ten to 15 minutes. The target number forces you to look for more different and creative ideas beyond the predictable. The time limit stops you from judging the ideas.
One of the most common techniques for encouraging divergent thinking is brainstorming. This can be done in groups or alone, and it can be a good idea to use a whiteboard or sticky notes. Quickly, try to write ideas on the board or a different idea on each of the sticky notes. Having the ideas on sticky notes makes it much easier to group them or move them around to explore common relationships after the brainstorming is complete. Why not give this a try right now? After this video has finished, set your timer for five minutes and write down 20 new ideas to encourage people in your local area to do more exercise. Remember, don't judge your ideas and crazy ones are welcome.

Well done, you've completed another section of the course. You should now have a better idea of what divergent thinking is and how you can apply it. You should also be able to use brainstorming as a tool to rapidly develop a number of possible ideas or solutions to problems. Remember, the key to great brainstorming is to suspend fear and judgement, and to let your imagination play with the impossible, as well as the improbable. You should also try to find out more about other creative thinkers. Talk to creative people about their thinking processes and see if you can pick up any tips. Well done on all the hard work in this section. I hope it was fun, as well.

Hello, and welcome back. I hope you've been putting your newly acquired creative-thinking skills to good use since we last met. If you have several ideas for a creative project, how do you decide which one to take forward? Do you tend to choose the first one you thought of or the easiest one to implement? In this section of the course, you will learn how to evaluate the creative ideas you've come up with and you're also going to be looking at how we can give and get feedback on creative ideas, an invaluable skill to develop for the workplace. As ever, try to use some of these ideas and techniques in your day-to-day life and see how they work in practice.

Well done on completing this section of the course. You're at the halfway mark now. I hope you're feeling proud of everything you've managed to achieve so far. Hopefully, we've given you plenty to think about, and you'll now have a collection of techniques to help you evaluate your ideas and to get useful and productive feedback from other people. Being able to give people useful feedback and suggestions is also a great skill to develop, but remember that it needs to be done with humility and sensibility. If you are open about your ideas and you aren't offended when people ignore your suggestions, they are likely to come back and ask for your advice again. Good luck and see you in the next section.

Welcome back. How do you feel during the creative process? Why do you think you sometimes feel like giving up? Persistence is vital for creative problem solving, but it's not always easy to keep going. In this part of the course, we'll be looking at some real-life success stories and how these emerged from difficulties that people encountered with their ideas, and we'll be learning what original thinkers do differently in the face of failure. So, by the end of this section, you'll be welcoming your mistakes or failures, and relishing the opportunity to learn and grow from them. I hope you enjoy this section of the course.

Most of us fear failure, especially in public settings, and this fear of failure can have a negative impact on our ability to be creative. However, being innovative involves taking risks, and where there is risk, there is also the possibility of failure. Anyone who's created something original will tell you: failure is an essential part of being creative. Of course it's not failure itself that leads to the creation of something new, it's how you deal with failure. The important factor in turning failure into success is the ability to learn from it and not to give up.
One feature of creative thinking is the will to improve, and in order to improve, you must be able to recognise and learn from mistakes. Many artists are obsessed with creating the perfect artwork and are very critical of their own work. They might constantly try to improve it, even if it means coming back to an idea weeks, months or even years later. Their idea might evolve so that they end up with something completely different from what they originally conceived.
In the world of business startups, the idea of pivoting comes from this ability to learn from what looks like failure and make it into something new. A classic example of a business pivot is YouTube. It was originally designed as an online dating website to help people find partners, but nobody was creating the kind of personal profile they expected. So instead, it became one of the world's largest video resources of user-generated content.
Some innovative companies try to make space for creativity and risk by giving their employees personal-project time, during which they can work on any project they want and experiment without the expectation that the time will end in a product. These projects have in many cases developed into very successful and innovative ideas. For example, Twitter was a side project because people were given the space to fail, to learn and to develop. In order to be creative, we must overcome our fear of failure.
So often our creative ideas are thought of as risky and so instead, we choose the safer route. But safe work is rarely creative work or the work we are most passionate about, and without passion and motivation, we are unlikely to produce anything really original and creative. So, as a creative thinker, you need to take risks with your ideas, be willing to make mistakes, view every failure as a chance to learn and don't give up.

You've learnt that being creative often involves taking risks and getting used to a degree of uncertainty. Many people who have created great art, founded successful companies and designed innovative products have also been through periods when they were very close to failing or had actually failed.
Failure is definitely not enjoyable, and you have to endure the discomfort in order to learn from it. Many people dream of running a business, but it‚Äôs risky, and in the UK, according to the Small Business Association, 30 per cent of new businesses fail in their first year.

You've learnt how taking risks is an important part of the creative process. But it's only a productive part of the process if you keep learning and developing. Many organisations and businesses now use continuous development processes as they develop creative ideas, to make sure they keep on the right track with their solutions.

Well done. You've completed another section of the course, and I hope by now you've learned how essential it is to be prepared to take risks and to realise that everyone feels fears and doubts about voicing their creative ideas. Also, be open to continuously developing your creative ideas and solutions. In this spirit of development, be sure to review your notes from the start of the course until now, to see how your thinking is progressing.

Welcome back. Have you ever been won over by a funny advert or moving charity campaign? What was it about the way the message was conveyed that was impactful for you? Have you got any favourite visual artists or writers, and if so, what is it about their work that inspires you? In this section, we'll be looking at a range of creative techniques and ideas that should help you to communicate your ideas. There's still a lot to do, so let's get started.

So you've come up with a creative solution to a problem ‚Äì but how are you going to get others on board with your idea? Whether you are trying to convince friends and family, the head of your college or your boss, when it comes to sharing your ideas and helping people to understand them, using visual and verbal creativity can really help to convince people.

Visual creativity isn't just a skill for artists. Many jobs require or can benefit from visual-thinking techniques, and everyone has the ability to think visually. Visual communication has a number of benefits. It makes ideas more memorable. It can help to communicate ideas quickly. It can help to simplify complex ideas. It can make patterns and links become clearer, and it can provide evidence that people find very convincing, because they see it for themselves. If you are worried about your drawing, photography or graphic design skills, don't be. You don't have to be a brilliant artist to be visually creative, and the more you start to practise, the better you will get at it. Also, you could start collecting a portfolio of images to refer to for inspiration.
Verbal creativity can also really help you to convey an idea in ways that people will remember. Being able to sum things up with a memorable strapline, or being able to produce a concise summary of your idea, can really help you to communicate in an entertaining and dynamic way. Try brainstorming a group of words that you associate with your idea. What are the key qualities and values you want to convey? Always aim to use the minimum number of words to convey your idea. Don't be tempted to overexplain. Straplines or mottos are great and can really make your idea memorable if you can think of a good one. But keep them simple and aim for no more than ten words.
Also, never underestimate the power of stories. Narrative can be a great way of conveying an idea. If you really want somebody to understand your idea, build a story around it. You can make this personal by telling your own story and how the idea comes from your life, or you can build it around a fictional character or persona that your listeners can identify with.
Of course, the most powerful way to convey any idea is with the combination of words and images. This is what advertisers really excel at. Think about the most memorable and persuasive campaigns and advertisements you have seen. Try to study them and understand what makes them so powerful, and then take these ideas and fuse them with your own to deliver your message.

People who work in marketing are often very skilled in the use of words to connect with their audience. They have to grab people's attention and convey a message within minutes or even seconds. To do this they often work with what is familiar but make small changes to it.

During this course, you have been through a creative process which has helped you to think creatively to solve a problem.
There are many ways to approach the creative process, but it is important to make sure you go through some key steps. Creative projects can fail because the innovators are missing out a vital part of the process, such as evaluating their ideas, getting feedback on their ideas or communicating their ideas effectively.
Now, watch the video that you watched at the start of the course again and think about how your creative process was similar to or different from what's described. Did you cover all of the steps outlined in the video?
Many people think of creativity as a moment of inspiration. They imagine an artist or inventor sitting alone when suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, an idea appears. The reality, though, is that creativity isn't something that happens in a moment. It takes time, and ideas are developed, redeveloped, refined and transformed through a process. There are many different forms this process can take, but this is a useful one that you can apply to any project or problem that requires a creative solution.
The process has seven steps. 1 Understand, 2 Define or redefine, 3 Generate, 4 Evaluate, 5 Share, 6 Reflect and 7 Create.
Step 1: Understand. This is where you identify your problem and what it is you want to achieve.
Step 2: Define. This is where you start asking questions and analyse your problem or goal in more detail, and develop a better understanding of who is involved and what the key influences are.
Step 3: Generate. This is where you start to brainstorm and generate ideas and possible solutions.
Step 4: Evaluate. This is where you start to define and refine your solution and how it will be realised.
Step 5: Share. This is the stage at which you present your ideas to other groups or individuals and start to get feedback and constructive input.
Step 6: Reflect. This is the stage at which you go back to your idea with the feedback you have gathered and see if you missed anything or if you need to work through Steps 3 to 6 again. In extreme cases, you may have to go right back to Step 1 and look again at whether you have really understood the problem; but once again, the important thing here is that you don't give up. You should expect to repeat parts of this process. Very few people get it right first time, however creative they are. Step
7: Create. This is the stage at which you make your plans a reality and build your solution. Following a guiding process like this can help you structure your creative thinking and make it more productive.
